In Vimâ€™s terminology, a window is a viewport onto a buffer. 
We can open multiple windows, each containing the same buffer, or we can load
different buffers into each window.

<C-w>s --> divide horizontally
<C-w>v --> divide vertically
The two resulting split windows will contain the same buffer as the original window

:sp {file} --> Split the current window horizontally, loading {file} into the new
window

:vsp {file} --> Split the current window vertically, loading {file} into the new
window

<C-w>w  --> Cycle between open windows
<C-w>h  --> Focus the window to the left
<C-w>j  --> Focus the window below
<C-w>k  --> Focus the window above
<C-w>l  --> Focus the window to the right

:cl[ose] --> Close the active window
:on[ly] --> Keep only the active window, closing all others

<C-w>= --> Equalize width and height of all windows
