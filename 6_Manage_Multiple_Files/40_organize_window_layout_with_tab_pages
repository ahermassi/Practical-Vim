Suppose that we’re at work on a project, with our workspace divided into a
few split windows. Out of the blue, something urgent comes up and we have
to switch contexts. Rather than opening new files in our current tab page,
which would mess up our carefully assembled workspace, we can create a
new tab page and do the work there. When we’re ready to resume our previous
work, we just have to switch back to the original tab page where all of our
windows will have been preserved as we left them.

:tabe 01 - Open the 01 markdown file in a new tab

<C-w>T - move the current window into its own tab

:tabc - close the current tab

:tabo - keep the active tab page, close all tabs

gt - move to next tab; equivalent to :tabn
gT - move to previous tab; equivalent to :tabp
{N}gt - move to tab N; equivalent to :tabn N
