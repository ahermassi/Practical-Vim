The argument list represents the list of files that was passed as an argument
when we ran the vim command.
vim *.txt
:args
[a.txt] b.txt c.txt. d.txt e.txt
The [] characters indicate which of the files in the
argument list is active.

 We can also set the contents of the argument list using
this form :args {arglist}
The {arglist} can include filenames, wildcards, or even the output from a shell
command.

➾ :args index.html app.js
➾ :args
❮ [index.html] app.js

The ** wildcard also
matches zero or more characters, but it can recurse downward into directories
below the specified directory.
We can combine these wildcards and use partial filenames or directories to
form patterns, also known as globs, that match the set of files we’re interested
in. 

Just as we can use more than one filename in the {arglist}, we can also supply
more than one glob.
➾ :args **/*.js **/*.css

➾ :args `cat chapters`
Vim executes the text inside the backtick characters in the shell, using the
output from the cat command as the argument for the :args command (chapters file)

We can traverse the files in the argument list using
:next and :prev commands. Or we can use :argdo to execute the same command
on each buffer in the set.
