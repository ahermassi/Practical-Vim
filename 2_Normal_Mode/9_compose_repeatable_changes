Vim is optimized for repetition. In order to exploit this, we have to be mindful
of how we compose our changes.

Pressing db deletes from the cursor’s starting position to the beginning of the
word.

The daw command is easily remembered by the mnemonic delete a word. This technique doesn’t
just remove the word, it also deletes a whitespace character. 

Making effective use of the dot command often requires some forethought. If
you notice that you have to make the same small change in a handful of
places, you can attempt to compose your changes in such a way that they
can be repeated with the dot command.
