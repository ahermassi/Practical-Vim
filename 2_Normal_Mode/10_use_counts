The <C-a> and <C-x> commands perform addition and subtraction on numbers.
When run without a count they increment by one, but if we prefix a number,
then we can add or subtract by any whole number. 
For example, if we positioned our cursor on a 5 character, running 10<C-a> would modify it to read
15.

If the cursor is not already positioned
on a number, then the <C-a> command will look ahead for a digit on the current line. If it finds one, it jumps straight to it.
