In other text editors, invoking the undo command after typing a few words
might revert the last typed word or character. However, in Vim we can control
the granularity of the undo command.

The u key triggers the undo command, which reverts the most recent change.
A change could be anything that modifies the text in the document. That
includes commands triggered from Normal, Visual, and Command-Line modes,
but a change could also encompass any text entered (or deleted) in Insert
mode. So we could also say that i{insert some text}<Esc> constitutes a change.

In Vim, we can control the granularity of the undo command. From the
moment we enter Insert mode until we return to Normal mode, everything we
type (or delete) counts as a single change.

Make each “undoable chunk” correspond to a thought.
