In Vim, we can control the granularity of the undo command.

The u key triggers the undo command, which reverts the most recent change.
A change could be anything that modifies the text in the document. That
includes commands triggered from Normal, Visual, and Command-Line modes,
but a change could also encompass any text entered (or deleted) in Insert
mode. 

From the moment we enter Insert mode until we return to Normal mode, 
everything we type (or delete) counts as a single change.

Make each “undoable chunk” correspond to a thought.
