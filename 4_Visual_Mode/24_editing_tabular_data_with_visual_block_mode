We can work with rows of text in any editor, but manipulating columns of text
requires a more specialized tool. Vim provides this capability in the form of its
Visual-Block mode.

We use <C-v> to engage Visual-Block mode; then we define the column
selection by moving our cursor.

We can reselect our last visual selection
using the gv command.
