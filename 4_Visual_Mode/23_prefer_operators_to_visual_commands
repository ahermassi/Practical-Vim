Visual mode may be more intuitive than Vim’s Normal mode of operation, but
it has a weakness: it doesn’t always play well with the dot command. We can
route around this weakness by using Normal mode operators when appropriate.

When a Visual mode command is repeated, it
affects the same range of text, i.e the same number of characters.

If we want to set up the dot command so that it repeats something useful,
then we’re better off staying out of Visual mode. As a general rule, we should 
prefer operator commands over their Visual mode equivalents when working
through a repetitive set of changes.
