Some Visual mode commands perform the same basic function as in Normal
mode but with a slight twist. For example, the c command is consistent in
both modes in that it deletes the specified text and then switches to Insert
mode.

From Normal mode, we trigger the change command first and then specify the range
as a motion. Whereas in Visual mode, we start off by making the
selection and then trigger the change command.

Run viw to visually select the word.

In a typical text editing environment, selected text is deleted when we type any
printable character. Vim’s Visual mode doesn’t follow this convention—but Select
mode does. We can toggle between Visual and Select modes by pressing <C-g> . The only visible
difference is the message at the bottom of screen, which switches between -- VISUAL --
and -- SELECT --.
