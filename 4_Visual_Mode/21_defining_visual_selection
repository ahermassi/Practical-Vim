The v key is our gateway into Visual mode. From Normal mode, we can press
v by itself to enable character-wise Visual mode. Line-wise Visual mode is
enabled by pressing V , and block-wise Visual mode by pressing <C-v>.

The gv command is a useful little shortcut. It reselects the range of text that
was last selected in Visual mode.

If weâ€™re in character-wise Visual
mode, we can switch to the line-wise variant by pressing V, or to block-wise
Visual mode with <C-v>. But if we were to press v from character-wise Visual
mode, it would switch us back into Normal mode. So you can think of the v
key as a toggle between Normal mode and character-wise Visual mode.

The range of a Visual mode selection is marked by two ends: one end is fixed
and the other moves freely with our cursor. We can use the o key to toggle
the free end.
