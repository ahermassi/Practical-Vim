The delete and yank commands allow us to set the contents of
a register, while the put command allows us to get the contents of a register
by inserting it into the document.

The expression register is different. It can evaluate a piece of Vim script code
and return the result.

The expression register is addressed by the = symbol. From Insert mode we
can access it by typing <C-r>=. This opens a prompt at the bottom of the screen
where we can type the expression that we want to evaluate. When done, we
hit <CR>, and Vim inserts the result at our current position in the document.
