delete and yank commands -> set the contents of a register.
put command -> get the contents of a register by inserting it into the document.

The expression register is different. It can evaluate a piece of Vim script code
and return the result.

<C-r>= -> access the expression register. This opens a prompt at the bottom of the screen
where we can type the expression that we want to evaluate. When done, we
hit <CR>, and Vim inserts the result at our current position in the document.
