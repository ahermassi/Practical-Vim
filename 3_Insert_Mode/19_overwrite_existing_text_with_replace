Replace mode is identical to Insert mode, except that it overwrites existing text
in the document.

R command ->  From Normal mode engage in Replace mode.

gR - > trigger Virtual Replace mode which treats the tab character as though it consisted of spaces.

r{char} and gr{char} ->  overwrite a single character before switching straight back to Normal mode.
