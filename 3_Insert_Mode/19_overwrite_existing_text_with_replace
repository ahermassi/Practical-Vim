Replace mode is identical to Insert mode, except that it overwrites existing text
in the document.

From Normal mode, we can engage Replace mode with the R command. And when weâ€™re finished with Replace mode, we can hit the <Esc> key to return
to Normal mode.

Vim has a second variant of Replace mode. Virtual Replace mode is triggered
with gR and treats the tab character as though it consisted of spaces.

Vim also provides a single-shot version of Replace mode and Virtual Replace
mode. The r{char} and gr{char} commands allow us to overwrite a single
character before switching straight back to Normal mode.
