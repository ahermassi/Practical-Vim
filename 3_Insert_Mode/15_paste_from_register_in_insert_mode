In Insert mode, we can press
<C-r>0 to paste the text that we just yanked at the current cursor position.

The general format of the command is <C-r>{register}, where {register} is the
address of the register we want to insert.

The <C-r><C-p>{register} command is smarter. It inserts text literally and fixes
any unintended indentation.
