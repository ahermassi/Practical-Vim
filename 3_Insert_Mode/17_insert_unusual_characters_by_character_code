<C-v>{code}, where {code} is the address of the character that we want to insert.

Vim expects the numeric code to consist of three digits. 
To insert an uppercase “A” character, the character code is 65, so we would have 
to enter it as <C-v>065.

If you want to find out the numeric code for any character in your document,
just place the cursor on it and trigger the ga command.
