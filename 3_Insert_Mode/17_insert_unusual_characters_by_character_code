Vim can insert any character by its numeric code. This can be handy for
entering symbols that are not found on the keyboard.

We can tell Vim to insert any arbitrary character if we know its numeric code.
From Insert mode, we just have to type <C-v>{code}, where {code} is the address
of the character that we want to insert.

Vim expects the numeric code to consist of three digits. Suppose, for example,
that we wanted to insert an uppercase “A” character. The character code is
65, so we would have to enter it as <C-v>065.

If you want to find out the numeric code for any character in your document,
just place the cursor on it and trigger the ga command.
