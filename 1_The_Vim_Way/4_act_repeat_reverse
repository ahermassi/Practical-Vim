When facing a repetitive task, we can achieve an optimal editing strategy by
making both the motion and the change repeatable. 

If we know how to repeat our actions without having to spell them out every
single time, then we can be more efficient. First we act; then we repeat.

, key -> repeat the last f{char} search in the reverse direction.

The following table summarizes Vimâ€™s repeatable commands along with their corresponding
reverse action:

Intent	    			  ||  Act	       ||     Repeat||   Reverse
********************************************************************************
Make a change	 		  || {edit}	       ||       .   ||     u
Scan line for next character 	  || f{char}/t{char}   ||       ;   ||     ,
Scan line for previous character  || F{char}/T{char}   ||       ;   ||     ,
Scan document for next match      || /pattern<CR>      ||       n   ||     N
Scan document for previous match  || ?pattern<CR>      ||       n   ||     N
