The dot command lets us repeat the last change. It is the most powerful and
versatile command in Vim.

The dot command “repeats the last change”.

The “last change” could be one of many things. A change could act at the level of
individual characters, entire lines, or even the whole file.

From the moment we enter Insert mode (by pressing i, for example) until we return to Normal mode
(by pressing <Esc>), Vim records every keystroke. After making a change such as this, the dot 
command will replay our keystrokes.
