The s command compounds two steps into one: it deletes the character under
the cursor and then enters Insert mode.

The f{char} command tells Vim to look
ahead for the next occurrence of the specified character and then move the
cursor directly to it if a match is found. So when we type f+, our
cursor goes straight to the next + symbol.

The ; command will repeat the last search that the f command performed.
