Just like in the shell, we can use the <Tab> key to autocomplete commands at
the prompt.

Vim is smart about picking suggestions for tab-completion. It looks at the
context of what has already been typed at the command line and builds a list
of suitable suggestions.

The <C-d> command asks Vim to reveal a list of possible completions. 
If we hit the <Tab> key, the prompt will cycle through the options.
