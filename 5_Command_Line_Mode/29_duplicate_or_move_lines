The :copy command (and its shorthand :t) lets us duplicate one or more lines
from one part of the document to another, while the :move command lets us
place them somewhere else in the document.

The format of the copy command goes like this: :[range]copy {address}

So we can read the :6copy. command as
“Make a copy of line 6 and put it below the current line.”

Command	  		Effect
************************************************************************ 
:6t. 		Copy line 6 to just below the current line
:t6 		Copy the current line to just below line 6
:t. 		Duplicate the current line (similar to Normal mode yyp)
:t$ 		Copy the current line to the end of the file
:'<,'>t0 	Copy the visually selected lines to the start of the file

When duplicating a distant line, the :t command is usually more efficient.

The :move command looks similar to the :copy command. 
We can shorten it to a single letter: :m
