It can sometimes be quicker to use an Ex command than to get the same job
done with Vimâ€™s Normal commands. For example, Normal commands tend
to act on the current character or the current line, whereas an Ex command
can be executed anywhere. This means that we can use Ex commands to
make changes without having to move our cursor. But the greatest feature
that distinguishes Ex commands is their ability to be executed across many
lines at the same time.
