At Vimâ€™s command line, the <C-r><C-w> mapping copies the word under the
cursor and inserts it at the command-line prompt.

Use <C-r><C-a> to get the WORD.

For another application, try opening your vimrc file, place your cursor on a
setting, and then type :help <C-r><C-w> to look up the documentation for that
setting.
