Vim records the commands that we enter in Command-Line mode and provides
two ways of recalling them: scrolling through past command-lines with the
cursor keys or dialing up the command-line window.

To begin with, let’s switch to Command-Line mode by pressing the : key.
Leave the prompt empty; then press the <Up> arrow key. The command line
should be populated with the most recent Ex command that we executed. 

Now try typing :help, followed by the <Up> key. Again, this should scroll through
previous Ex commands, but instead of showing everything, the list will be
filtered to only include Ex commands that started with the word “help.”

Vim keeps a separate record of our search history. If we press / to bring up the search prompt, we can
also scroll backward and forward through previous searches with the <Up>
and <Down> keys. 

Press q: and meet the command-line window. 
The command-line window is like a regular Vim buffer, where each line contains an item from our history.
We can navigate with any of the motions we’re accustomed to using in Normal mode.

We can close the command-line window by running the :q command.
