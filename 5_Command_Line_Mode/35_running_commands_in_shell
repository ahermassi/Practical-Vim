From Vim’s Command-Line mode, we can invoke external programs in the
shell by prefixing them with a bang symbol !

Note the difference between :!ls and :ls—the former calls the ls command in
the shell, whereas :ls calls Vim’s built-in command, which shows the contents
of the buffer list.

What if we want to run several commands in the shell? In that case, we can use Vim’s :shell
command to start an interactive shell session.
The exit command kills the shell and returns us to Vim.

Pressing Ctrl -z suspends the process that’s running Vim and
returns control to bash. The Vim process sits idle in the background, allowing us to
interact with our bash session as normal.

In bash, we can use the fg command to resume a suspended job, bringing it back
into the foreground. That brings Vim back to life exactly as we left it.
