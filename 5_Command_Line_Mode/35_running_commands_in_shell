From Vim’s Command-Line mode, we can invoke external programs in the
shell by prefixing them with a bang symbol !

:!ls calls the ls command in the shell
:ls calls Vim’s built-in command, which shows the contents of the buffer list.

To run several commands in the shell, :shell command starts an interactive shell session.
The exit command kills the shell and returns us to Vim.

Ctrl -z suspends the process that’s running Vim and returns control to bash.

In bash, we can use the fg command to resume a suspended job, bringing it back
into the foreground. That brings Vim back to life exactly as we left it.
