Many Ex commands can be given a [range] of lines to act upon. We can specify
the start and end of a range with either a line number, a mark, or a pattern.

:print -> echo the specified lines below Vimâ€™s command line

:N -> move cursor to line N

:1 -> jump to the top of the file 

:$ -> jump to the end of the file

:p is the abbreviated form of :print
:3p -> print the 3rd line

:3d -> jump to line 3 and delete it. The equivalent Normal mode commands would
be 3G followed by dd.

:2,5p -> print each line from 2 to 5, inclusive. Note that after running this
command, the cursor would be left positioned on line 5.

. symbol represents the current line.
:.,$p -> range representing everything from here to the end of the file

% symbol stands for all the lines in the current file
:%p is equivalent to running :1,$p

If we run the command 2G followed by VG, we would make a
visual selection. If we press the : key now, the command-line prompt will be prepopulated
with the range :'<,'>. It is simply a range standing for the visual selection. 
Then we can specify our Ex command, and it will execute on every selected line.

The general form for an offset goes like this: :{address}+n
If n is omitted, it defaults to 1. 
:.,.+3 is equivalent to :2,5 if the cursor is positioned on line 2.
