:normal -> run a Normal mode command on a series of consecutive lines

:'<,'>normal . -> For each line in the visual selection, execute the Normal mode . command

:%normal A; -> append a semicolon at the end of every line of the file

Before executing the specified Normal mode command on each line, Vim
moves the cursor to the beginning of the line. So we donâ€™t have to worry about
where the cursor is positioned when we execute the command.
